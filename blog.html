<center><h3 id="image1"> Looking Out For Details </h3></center>
<center><p class="text"> Throughout this unit I learned about the different properties that make up a website. I was never aware on how a website was actually programed and just learning about the differences betweem html and css is a major acoplishment. The thing that most resonated to me about this was that html is the actual information and the content of your website and css is what "makes it pretty". It may seem dificult at first but once you get the hang of it it becomes really easy. However, you always need to be extra careful on doing all the right steps because one wrong comand and everything gets messed up. I learned that it is extremly important to pay a lot of atention to the little details. This is because the computer doesn't have a mind of it's own and it needs you, the individual, to tell it exactly what to do. It won't guess what's your real inention. One example of this is that everytime you want to make a comand/action you need to open and close the atributes so that everything is in place. Without these closures the website will look very funky and some of the information wouldn't even show up.</p></center>

 <center><p class="text">Another thing that I learned in this Web Design unit was that there are a lot of things that can always be modified and improoved in your website. Everyone had to start from the beginning, a blank page, and it was up to the designer to add more detail and elegancy to their websites. There are so many properties that we can all play with and it's very important to understand that everyone has the capacity and information to create a high-quality page. It made me realize how everyone has the power but not all of us are aware that we are capable of using it. I found it really interesting how a lot of people see managing the web as a really difficult task and I hadn't discovered otherwise until I learned how to create a website on my own. From this unit, I also realized that it is important to teach others about how we have the information/instructions to publish and create a website. It is as simple as learning throughout Khan Academy and W3schools. However, it is important to take action on helping those comunities that don't have the access to this type of technology because anyone can make a career out of Web Design.</p></center>
